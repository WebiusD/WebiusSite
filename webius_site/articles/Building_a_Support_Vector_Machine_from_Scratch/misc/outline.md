# Derive the normal objective function with the linear constraint
- Explain that this objective function is only for linear separation of dataset.
- plug in the linear constraint equation, by solving the constraint function for xi
- explain that this objective function is not suitable for gradient descend
- replace constraint part with hinge loss to make it appropriate for gradient descend (-> why?)
- write python code which solves the objective functions with grad descend

# Expand the normal objective function with kernels to allow for non-linear separation boundaries of the data
