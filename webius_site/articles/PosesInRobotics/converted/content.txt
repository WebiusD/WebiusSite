A robot is a mechanical device that can execute tasks autonomously or with
minimal human intervention. The category of robots that handles or interacts with objects in their
environment are called manipulators. Manipulators consist of multiple segments called links, joints
connecting two or more links and actuators that drive the links. Often times each joint features
a dedicated actuator that controls the joint position. In such cases the terms joint and actuator
are used interchangeably. Most manipulators also have an end-effector, that can interact with the
environment. The arrangement of links, joints and actuators determines how the robot can move
and is called its kinematic. By analyzing the kinematics of a robot we can gain insights about its
range of motion, workspace limitations and how to control movements to achieve desired tasks.
The robots forward kinematics govern, how the position of the end-effector can be computed, from
a set of joint angles or joint displacements. It is essentially the process of calculating the position
of each link in the workspace. The reverse problem, starts with the position of the end-effector and
tries to compute a possible set of joint values (or displacements), required to achieve that posi-
tion. The solution to this problem is governed by the robots inverse kinematics and is particularly
useful in tasks such as path planning and trajectory generation. While the forward kinematics
are unambiguous and fast to compute, the calculation of an inverse-kinematics-problem is much
more involved. In fact, an inverse kinematics problem may have one, multiple (even infinite) or no
solution.
This work focuses onto a specific kind of manipulator, whos links are all connected in serial using
rotary joints. A popular example of a serial manipulator is the UR10 from Universal Robots (see
figure 5). If an end-effector were to be used, it would be attached to link 6. The fixed link is
called the robots base. Such serial manipulators are among the most popular robots for industrial
applications, because they are versatile and have a far range compared to their size.

The majority of serial manipulators feature six motored joints (or axis), providing them with six
degrees of freedom. In general, the degrees of freedom of a mechanism with links and joints can
be calculated using Grüblers formula [16]. In the following the term robot always refers to six-axis
serial manipulators, unless explicitly stated otherwise. In order to instruct a robot to perform
a certain task, it first needs to be teached. Teaching a robot involves either programming or
training the robot to execute certain actions or responses. Both methods, rely on the definition
of positions of the robot. The most rigorous way to define a position is by the specification of a
value for each joint of the robot. As mentioned earlier, such a specification does, unambiguously
determine the position of every single point in the robot’s kinematic chain. The position of the
end-effector is no exception, and can be calculated by means of the robots forward kinematics. Such
a clearly defined position is referred to as a configuration of the robot. However, when teaching a
robot it’s hard to think in terms of joint values and the robot’s corresponding configuration. The
position and orientation of the end-effector is an abstraction that is much easier to visualize and
reason about. In robotics this is the pose of the end-effector. “The combination of position and
orientation we call pose. A pose always needs to be defined with respect to some reference
frame. Almost all robotic applications exclusively use orthonormal reference frames. Since an
orthonormal reference frame always consist of mutually perpendicular basis vectors of length one,
the remaining information is that of its position and orientation. Thus, reference frames can
themselves be described as a pose. Under these constraints the quantities frame and pose comprise
the same properties and can be used interchangeably. However, when we refer to a fixed coordinate
system, they are still commonly referred to as frames.
$$A$$ pose $$Q$$ that is defined with respect to a frame $$A$$, describes a new frame $$B$$ (see figure 6). Such
a relative pose quantifies the transformation required to move from frame $$A$$ to $$B$$ and is denoted
by A QB .An important property of relative poses, is that they can be composed, so A QB = A QC · C QB .
That is, the pose B relative to A can be obtained by transforming B into an intermediary frame
C and from there into the target frame A. Also a relative pose A QB will transform a vector given
in frame B into a vector with respect to A:
